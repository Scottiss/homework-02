# What was done

I added a dark themed nav bar across all HTML files.
I made sure to keep the html and css code as clean as possible by using comments where i thought was necessary
I tried something different with an embeded media player on 2 of the cards on my portfolio, unfortunately the do not respond as well to screen size as images do.
Made sure the title of each page was correct and made sure all links routed you to the correct page and made sure the page on the navbar was active to which page you were on.
Instead of using a very boring and mundane background color, I made it a blurred image of mountains for viewing pleasure.
I double checked all links in my socials page to make sure they all work and used a mailto command for the email with a predetermined subject.
